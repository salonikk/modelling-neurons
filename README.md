### Hodgkin-Huxley.py

Code for two neurons, modelled using the Hodgkin Huxley equations, that interact by inhibiting each other. In this model, the length of each bout is recorded, and the probability at each time step (t) of a bout occuring that is greater than t is recorded and plotted. 
Because of a slow run time, for modelling the effects of the locus coeruleus on the probability of a bout occuring will be later tested using the integrate and fire model.
